# ![logo](https://www.tylertech.com/Portals/0/Logo-NavBar.jpg?ver=Js0wL8bzpXBsBHn_bv-Kjg%3d%3d) Tyler Data Pipeline Certification 
These instructions and resources are intended to walk through
the technical process of certifying data in the Tyler Judicial
Analytics Pipeline. This is a prerequisite to be granted access
to the staging pipeline.

Vendors will leverage their vendor specific authorization token
and the Judicial Analytics Pipeline to upload and validate data. A
connection will qualify for certification and verification if a
`SUCCESS` response is received for at least 10 records per program, and there are no errors within the
Pipeline’s internal logs.

Each Vendor should submit all available data elements and
specifically include all pipeline critical elements noted in the
Pipeline Critical Elements section below. The submission is
considered acceptable if no validation errors are triggered and
the required data elements contai*n* a value suitable for its
respective datatype. **Certification will occur by program per
county.**

**Important: For courts integration, a completed Court Data
Elements Mapping Tool must be returned to AOIC before
certification can begin.**

## Prerequisites

The following are required to begin the Certification
Process:

* A minimum of 10 records reflecting data requirements per
program (Probation, Pretrial, PSC, and Courts)
* Vendor specific Credential Pair 
* Submission of the Court Mapping Tool to AOIC *(Courts
Program only)

Data Requirements

* Access to data for each of the critical and optional elements listed in the [vendor folder](https://tylertech.sharepoint.com/sites/Client/DI/AOIC/Program%201%20%203%20Prepare%20Solution/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FClient%2FDI%2FAOIC%2FProgram%201%20%203%20Prepare%20Solution%2FVendor%20docs%2FData%20Elements%20%2D%20ALL&FolderCTID=0x012000E4E5E251D4298743B4D89B00DBBF4D85&View=%7B0F3FBEB1%2DB9A9%2D4E2E%2D957E%2D9E4144F8F6F9%7D)

## Step 1: Get an Authorization (Bearer) Token
The Certification Instance of the Pipeline is access-controlled
such that each vendor has its own credential pair. A credential
pair consists of a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Vendors should
have received a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` via a secure email.

Vendors will use this pair to get a bearer token that will allow
them to interact with the Judicial Analytics Pipeline.
```
Note: this command will provide a bearer token that is valid for 60 minutes.
```
#### Example curl command 

```
curl https://tyler-alliance-system-dev.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --user YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
```
Please refer to the [API documentation](api) for more information.

## Step 2: Submit Messages to the Pipeline API
### Build the message
Every message consists of an `envelope`. The `envelope` contains a series of `events`, as well as metadata to help route the message appropriately

An example message might look like
```json
{
  "Events": [
    {
      "Entities": [
        {
          "EntityId": "AOIC",
          "EntityType": "di-aoic-problem-solving-courts-individual-background",
          "EntityData": {
              "name": "Dale Bell",
              "localid": 9152,
              "instanceid": "5008",
              "offenderid": "4354",
              "dateofbirth": "11/12/1982",
              "sexperceived": "Male",
              "pretrialbackgroundid": "2023-cook-asdf-tyl-9152",
              "county": "cook"
           }
        }
      ],
      "EventType": "di-aoic-new-record-event"
    }
  ]
}
```
Details for each attribute of the `Envelope` are:

| field            | allowed_type | required | description                                                                                     |
|------------------|--------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Events           | array        | Y        | An array of events. For more details. [See next section](#events)                               |

#### Events
Envelopes may consist of one or more `events`. Details for each attribute of the `Event` are:

| field            | allowed_type | required | description                                                         |
|------------------|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Entities          | array        | Y        | An array of events. For more details. [See next section](#entities) |
| EventType         | string       | Y        | Always set to `di-aoic-new-record-event`                            |

#### Entities
Entities are the most important part of the message. This specifies the program, the record and the values associated with that record. 
Details for each attribute are as follows

| field          | allowed_type | required | description                                                                                                                      |
|----------------|--------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EntityID       | string       | Y        | Always set to `AOIC`                                                                                                             |
| EntityType     | string       | Y        | Maps to the specific program and data in the format `di-[Program Name]-[Dataset Name]`. See [below for more examples](#examples) |
| EntityData     | object       | Y        | The record associated with this entity                                                                                           |

#### Entity Data
Every entity data object must contain the elements, in the format required, listed in the [vendor folder](https://tylertech.sharepoint.com/sites/Client/DI/AOIC/Program%201%20%203%20Prepare%20Solution/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FClient%2FDI%2FAOIC%2FProgram%201%20%203%20Prepare%20Solution%2FVendor%20docs%2FData%20Elements%20%2D%20ALL&FolderCTID=0x012000E4E5E251D4298743B4D89B00DBBF4D85&View=%7B0F3FBEB1%2DB9A9%2D4E2E%2D957E%2D9E4144F8F6F9%7D)

These should be passed as attributes in the object. For example
```json
"entityData": {
     "name": "Dale Bell",
     "localid": 9152,
     "instanceid": "5008",
     "offenderid": "4354",
     "dateofbirth": "11/12/1982",
     "sexperceived": "Male",
     "pretrialbackgroundid": "2023-cook-asdf-tyl-9152",
     "county": "cook"
  }
```

##### Notes on the entity data object
There are a couple of critical items to watch out for when building the entityData object:
* **Data Elements** - Each entity **must** include the required elements listed in the [vendor folder](https://tylertech.sharepoint.com/sites/Client/DI/AOIC/Program%201%20%203%20Prepare%20Solution/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FClient%2FDI%2FAOIC%2FProgram%201%20%203%20Prepare%20Solution%2FVendor%20docs%2FData%20Elements%20%2D%20ALL&FolderCTID=0x012000E4E5E251D4298743B4D89B00DBBF4D85&View=%7B0F3FBEB1%2DB9A9%2D4E2E%2D957E%2D9E4144F8F6F9%7D), in the format specified. Failure to include these elements, or to format them in the right way could result in certification failure
* **RowID** - The rowID is used to allow the vendor the maintain (modify, update, delete) the data after it's been submitted. This is a unique identifier for the object in the local source system. Each object **must** have a unique rowID.  


### Send the message
Using the Bearer Token received from the Step 1, and the message prepared in the previous section, send an API
call to **PUT** the Message built in the previous section. 

Sample cURL and PowerShell commands can be found [here](https://tylertech.sharepoint.com/sites/Client/DI/AOIC/Program%201%20%203%20Prepare%20Solution/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=XIcIAS&cid=a0eb1b19%2D1106%2D4d00%2D8323%2D8d93d5213bbc&RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FClient%2FDI%2FAOIC%2FProgram%201%20%203%20Prepare%20Solution%2FVendor%20docs%2FCertification%20directions%2Fcertification%5Fexample%5Fcommands&FolderCTID=0x012000E4E5E251D4298743B4D89B00DBBF4D85) to
demonstrate minimal examples for each data element set.

### Validate the response
A successful response will look like:
```json
{
  "status":"SUCCESS",
  "EnvelopeId": "UNIQUE-ENVELOPE-ID"
}
```
If you receive a successful response, repeat Step 2, utilizing the same 60-min token, to submit
additional record(s).

**Make sure to screenshot and copy the SUCCESS response
with the envelopeID, this is needed for Step 3**

## Step 3: Complete Certification
Vendors must email their SUCCESS response and EnvelopeID. **Note: Separate emails must be sent for each county program area**
* Send to: [data-certification@tylertech.com](mailto:data-certification@tylertech.com)
* Subject: Certification SUCCESS - [Program Area - County]

Tyler will confirm receipt of the email within 1 business day

Upon successful validation Tyler will submit the vendor’s certification with the State and notify the vendor that certification has been completed

1. Where can I find more information about the API?
   2. Please refer to the [API documentation](api) for more information.
2. What happens if I get a SUCCESS response but receive an
error message for data validation?
   * If there is an error in your submission, you’ll receive an
   email from AWS Notifications within a few minutes of your
   SUCCESS response.
   * See the notification email you received. Each error will
   have Error Details, which indicate the type of error
   encountered. Once fixed, please try to upload again. If you
   have issues resolving your issue, please reach out directly
   to the Tyler team at [data-certification@tylertech.com](mailto:data-certification@tylertech.com).
